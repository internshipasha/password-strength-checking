Password Strength Evaluation Report

Objective

Understand what makes a password strong or weak by testing passwords of varying complexity, analyzing password checker results, and summarizing best practices for secure password creation.

Tools

Online password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com, howsecureismypassword.net)

Optional: library-based strength testers like zxcvbn


Methodology

1. Created six test passwords with different levels of complexity.


2. Tested each password using an online strength checker.


3. Recorded password length, character composition, tool score, and feedback.


4. Analyzed why some passwords scored weak/strong.


5. Identified best practices for creating strong passwords.


6. Researched common password attacks.

Analysis

Passwords 1–2 were weak because they used dictionary words and predictable patterns (word + year).

Password 3 scored “very strong” in the tool due to length and mixed characters, but in reality it is still weak because attackers use pattern-aware dictionaries (common words + symbols + years).

Password 4 appeared strong, but its short length reduces true resistance to brute-force attacks.

Passwords 5–6 showed the best balance: long, unpredictable, and resistant to brute-force and dictionary attacks.

Best Practices for Strong Passwords

Use long passwords (16+ characters) or passphrases made of unrelated words.

Avoid dictionary words, predictable substitutions, and dates/years.

Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, but length is the most important factor.

Use a password manager to generate and store strong unique passwords.

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

Common Password Attacks

Brute force attack – tries all possible combinations until it finds the right one.

Dictionary attack – uses lists of common passwords/words to guess quickly.

Credential stuffing – attackers reuse stolen username/password pairs from data breaches.

Rainbow table attack – uses precomputed hash tables to reverse hashed passwords (defeated by salted hashing).

Conclusion

Password strength checkers often reward character variety and length, but real-world security depends on unpredictability and resistance to common attack patterns. The most secure passwords are long, unique, and stored safely with a password manager, combined with multi-factor authentication.
